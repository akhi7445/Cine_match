# CineMatch: Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview

CineMatch is a simple and efficient movie recommendation system built using Streamlit and Python. The system allows users to add, search, filter, and delete movies, as well as receive recommendations based on ratings. The project leverages in-memory data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms to provide a responsive and user-friendly experience.

## Key Features

- **Add Movies**: Users can input movie details including title, genre, rating, language, and production.
- **Search and Filter**: Search for movies by title, genre, or language, and filter the results based on these criteria.
- **Recommendations**: Get top N movie recommendations based on ratings, with options to sort by highest or lowest ratings.
- **Delete Movies**: Remove movies from the system by title.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Streamlit for creating an interactive web interface.
- **Backend**: Python for handling business logic and data processing.
- **Data Structures**: Lists and dictionaries for in-memory data management.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting and searching algorithms to optimize data handling and recommendations
